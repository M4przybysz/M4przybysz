### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a beginner game developer ðŸŽ®ðŸ–¥. I can make games in Godot game engine and in C++ with a graphics library like SFML or SDL2. 

I'm currently learning Unity.

I have multiple years of experience in coding in C/C++, Python, JavScript HTML, CSS and PHP.
I am open to cooperation and employment proposals.
